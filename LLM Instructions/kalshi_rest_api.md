        Endpoint for getting all trades for all markets. A trade represents a completed transaction between two users on a specific market. Each trade includes the market ticker, price, quantity, and timestamp information. Block trades are included in the response by default and identified by the `is_block_trade` field; use the `is_block_trade` query parameter to filter by block / non-block. This endpoint returns a paginated response. Use the 'limit' parameter to control page size (1-1000, defaults to 100). The response includes a 'cursor' field - pass this value in the 'cursor' parameter of your next request to get the next page. An empty cursor indicates no more pages are available.

      description: |
        Transfers funds within the same account.

        When `source_exchange_shard` and `destination_exchange_shard` are the same, Kalshi treats the request as a subaccount transfer. The returned transfer ID appears in the subaccount transfer history.

        Cross-exchange-index subaccount transfers run in up to three non-atomic steps. If a later step fails, completed steps are not undone, so funds may remain in the primary account on the source or destination exchange index.

        has blocked for one of its subtraders. The subtrader must belong to the
        requesting FCM. Blocks apply prospectively: new orders the subtrader
        places through its bound API credentials are rejected in markets whose
        event belongs to a blocked category, while orders already resting are
        not cancelled. Returns the subtrader's full resulting blocked set.
